# Flag to prevent from opening mine button

You can use flag to prevent from opening mine button accidentally. It is useful for you to think which buttons are hidding mine.

## Use flags
When you tap the upper center icon (default - <i class="fas fa-flag"></i>), the game would be into flagging mode. You can put some flags on mine button without opening. You can toggle playing game and putting flags each tapping on upper center icon.
