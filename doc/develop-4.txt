# Localization

I am not good at speaking English, but always develop programs in English. It might be slower than using Japanese. I hope that lots of programer reviews my source code. It might make the program better. I reached a small milestone about loading svg path. I try to localize this program to Japanese. 

## Localization ways
I could not decide the way to localize the text between html tags. 

1. echo the text in php and translate it by gettext library.
2. copy each php files to be translated and translate them.

Each ways have advantage and disadvantage. 

### Echoing the text advantage and disadvantage

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Advantage</td>
<td>It is easy to modify php code. You are not warried about forgetting modifing copied code in each duplicated php files.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disadvantage</td>
<td>Php is nice for source seeming html. It loose nice part to echo text between html tags.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Copying php files advantage and disadvantage

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Advantage</td>
<td>The translation file seems html. It is easy to recongnize the text to be translated.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Disadvantage</td>
<td>If php code part is lots, it is difficult to modify code on the file. You have to copy modified code to each translated files.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Using gettext  
I decided to use the former way. The followings are reason.

1. I can use .mo data on the browser side. It excite me to load .mo data with javascript. I prefer to use new way for me. I have not used node-gettext libraries.
2. It well known for developers to use gettext library. It make my program easy to be reviewd by many developers.
